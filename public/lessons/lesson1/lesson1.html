          <h2>The Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            We'll go over basic programming concepts in this section.  It won't be the most exciting, but definitely one of the most necessary lessons in this whole curriculum.  Programming is all about being able to basic things such as using loops or arrays.  You gotta know the basics before we dive into heavy game development.
